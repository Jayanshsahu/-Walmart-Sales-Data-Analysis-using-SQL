             This project presents an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis of Walmart Sales Data. The goal was
             to clean, transform, and extract insights from a retail transaction dataset using MySQL. It includes
             data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to draw valuable business insights


       ‚ùì Problem Statement

             Walmart wants to understand customer behavior and product performance by analyzing transactional data. Key goals are:

             Identify revenue trends across time and product categories

             Understand customer types, preferences, and demographics

             Analyze product performance and city/branch-level contributions

             Create new features like time_of_day, day_name, and month_name for better time-based insights


       üìÇ Raw Data Details
             Source: The dataset used in this project is a publicly available CSV file named WalmartSalesData.csv.

             Dataset Size: Contains 1,000+ transaction records with details across multiple retail branches of Walmart.

       üì• Data Access & Upload
             The dataset was loaded into the MySQL database using the following command:

             LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 
             'WalmartSalesData.csv'
             INTO TABLE sales
             FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
             ENCLOSED BY '"'
             LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
             IGNORE 1 ROWS;

       üßæ Data Preparation
             Table Name: sales
             Data Source: WalmartSalesData.csv (loaded via LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE)
             Columns:

             Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer Type, Gender

             Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity, VAT, Total

             Date, Time, Payment Method, COGS, Gross Income, Rating



       üß™ Feature Engineering
             Three additional columns were engineered:

Time of Day

             ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN time_of_day VARCHAR(20);
             UPDATE sales
             SET time_of_day = (
               CASE 
                 WHEN time BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '12:00:00' THEN 'Morning'
                 WHEN time BETWEEN '12:01:00' AND '16:00:00' THEN 'Afternoon'
                 ELSE 'Evening' 
               END
             );


       Day Name
       
             ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN day_name VARCHAR(10);
             UPDATE sales SET day_name = DAYNAME(date);


       Month Name
       
             ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10);
             UPDATE sales SET month_name = MONTHNAME(date);

             SELECT product_line, SUM(vat) AS VAT FROM sales 
             GROUP BY product_line ORDER BY VAT DESC LIMIT 1;



       üí∞ Sales Analysis
Q1. Sales per weekday per time of day?
